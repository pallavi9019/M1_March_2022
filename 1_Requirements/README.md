## Introduction
In quiz game, questions are chosen in such a a way that they cover all fields of a typical quiz contest. The user’s general knowledge is tested with quiz questions regarding science, technology, movies, sports, general health, geography and many more.

## Research
### QUIZ GAME...
The source code is to be compiled in Code::Blocks with gcc compiler. This quiz game in C is not designed to run on the Turbo C versions. The source code for this mini project is around 1000 lines, so I didn’t want to display it here.

## Cost and Features
Our quiz games put the fun into learning. Your knowledge will be tested regarding a variety of subjects, including geography, cultures, and cartoons. Well-traveled players will love showcasing their map skills in every continent. Answer questions about international borders and capitals to score points and advance.


## Defining Our System
* System bacically takes input from the user and executes the particular function the user selected, and then print the values.
In this quiz game mini project, you can store the user name, view the highest score secured by a user, and even reset the score. Additionally, to make the game look a little more interesting, it is divided into two rounds; user must pass the first round to reach the second one.

Of the 2 rounds I mentioned above, the first is called the Warm-up Round; the second is the Challenge round. In the warm-up round, the user is asked a total of three simple questions and they must be able to answer at least two of them correctly to enter the next round. If the user is not capable of doing that, he is not permitted to proceed further.
