# Requirements
## Introduction
 * Electrical Calculator is a conversion calculator provide a one-stop resource for numerous computations in the electronics industry. Whether you're looking for a 4 band resistor or seeking to figure out how long a battery lasts, this electrical calculator can assist. 
 * This project first takes the user to a index page where the available contents on type of calculator are listed and asks the user to give input for the respective topic he wants to calculate. User can also try run the example code by him/herself. User can also give suggestion to us. 

## Research
### Electrical Calculator...
* This is a simple project which simply provide required electrical parameters value to the user after taking input from the user. 
* This calculator is using various formulas for different functions,research are done in the particular calculation and theres need to be perequites before entering to the program

## Cost and Features
* This project has various features, like it can provide electrical parameters like volatge,current resistor value,battery life etc.. 
* In Resistor color code Calculator,it can give values of any band upto 6 bands.
* In ohms law Calculator,user can enter any two parameters(V,I,R,P) and can get other two parameter values.
* In LED series resistor Calculator,user can get resistor value to drive the LED by entering parameters.
* In Batter life Calculator,user can get the battery life in hours by entering the parameter.
#### above features are shown in the below screenshot.

## Defining Our System
* System bacically takes input from the user and executes the particular function the user selected, and then print the values.
* There are 4 types of functions in this Calculator
  * Resistor Color Code Calculator
  * Ohms law Calculator
  * LED series Resistor Calculator
  * Battery Life Calculator
